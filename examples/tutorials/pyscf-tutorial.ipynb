    "SchrÃ¶dinger's wave function is a useful mathematical construct for calculating the total energy of atoms and molecules, as well as other features. However, it can be very computationally expensive if used. (explain order of magnitude in Hamiltonian Eqn) Hence, the DFT is useful for calculating the ground state energy of larger molecules as it uses the electron density (experimentally observable) as well as wave functions to do so. \n",
