    "The XCModel class is used to initialize and run Differentiable Quantum Chemistry (i.e, DFT) calculations, using an exchange correlation functional that has been replaced by a neural network. The model parame- ters consist of the PyTorch model used to train the functional and the choice of loss function. The forward method initializes the Neural Network LDA layer (NNXC), and hybridizes the func- tional with a traditional LDA functional. The hybrid xc is used to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. Once the self consistent iterations converge, the total energy of the data point is calculated and used to calculate the loss.
