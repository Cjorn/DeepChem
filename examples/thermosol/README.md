# Thermodynamic Solubility

Thermodynamic solubility is interesting from a research perspective because it's quite hard to score 
high on this metric, even though the assay is relatively low-noise. 

The dataset contains data on thermodynamic solubility, pKa-A1 and pKa-B1. The dataset on thermodynamic
solubility contains 1743 examples, while the others contains 200 examples.

- dataset: {thermosol.csv, pKa-A1.csv, pKa-A2.csv}
