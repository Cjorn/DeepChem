class GAN(torch_model):
    """Implements Generative Adversarial Networks.

    A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model.  It
    consists of two parts called the "generator" and the "discriminator".  The
    generator takes random noise as input and transforms it into an output that
    (hopefully) resembles the training data.  The discriminator takes a set of
    samples as input and tries to distinguish the real training samples from the
    ones created by the generator.  Both of them are trained together.  The
    discriminator tries to get better and better at telling real from false data,
    while the generator tries to get better and better at fooling the discriminator.

    In many cases there also are additional inputs to the generator and
    discriminator.  In that case it is known as a Conditional GAN (CGAN), since it
    learns a distribution that is conditional on the values of those inputs.  They
    are referred to as "conditional inputs".

    Many variations on this idea have been proposed, and new varieties of GANs are
    constantly being proposed.  This class tries to make it very easy to implement
    straightforward GANs of the most conventional types.  At the same time, it
    tries to be flexible enough that it can be used to implement many (but
    certainly not all) variations on the concept.

    To define a GAN, you must create a subclass that provides implementations of
    the following methods:

    get_noise_input_shape()
    get_data_input_shapes()
    create_generator()
    create_discriminator()

    If you want your GAN to have any conditional inputs you must also implement:

    get_conditional_input_shapes()

    The following methods have default implementations that are suitable for most
    conventional GANs.  You can override them if you want to customize their
    behavior:

    create_generator_loss()
    create_discriminator_loss()
    get_noise_batch()

    This class allows a GAN to have multiple generators and discriminators, a model
    known as MIX+GAN.  It is described in Arora et al., "Generalization and
    Equilibrium in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00573).
    This can lead to better models, and is especially useful for reducing mode
    collapse, since different generators can learn different parts of the
    distribution.  To use this technique, simply specify the number of generators
    and discriminators when calling the constructor.  You can then tell
    predict_gan_generator() which generator to use for predicting samples.
