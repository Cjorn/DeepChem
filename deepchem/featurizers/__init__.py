class Featurizer(object):
  """
  Abstract class for calculating a set of features for a molecule.

  Child classes implement the _featurize method for calculating features
  for a single molecule. The feature matrix returned by featurize has a
  shape that is inferred from the shape of the features returned by
  _featurize, and is either indexed by molecules or by molecules and
  conformers depending on the value of the conformers class attribute.

  Class Attributes
  ----------------
  conformers : bool, optional (default False)
      Whether features are calculated for conformers. If True, the first
      two axes of the feature matrix will index molecules and conformers,
      respectively. If False, only molecule-level features are calculated
      and the feature matrix will not have a separate conformer dimension.
      This is a class attribute because some featurizers take 3D
      conformation into account and others do not, and this is not
      typically an instance-level decision.
  name : str or list
